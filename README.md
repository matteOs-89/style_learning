# style_learning using African Patterns

Style transfer is an technique that uses two images (content, style) to create a third artistic one. 
This is done using the feature maps of a pretrained convolutional neural network, this helps to stablish similierities between both images.

The paper on style transfer was published in 2015 by Gaty el al, and in this publication VGG19 pretrained model was used, here we will do the same.
style transfer gives room for layers exploration and hyper parameter tuning such as increasing or reducing the style scaling factor, 
or trying different combinations of feature maps in the the pretrained model to find the a satisfactory pattern.
